{"name":"Qua","tagline":"AppleScript to search for keywords in photos & e-mail them","body":"### What does it do?\r\n\r\nIt is a small script that finds photographs with predefined tag/keyword and e-mails them to user predefined e-mail address.\r\n\r\nReal life situation would look like that: I tag a photograph of my kid (in Lightroom/Bridge or basically any other app) that I want to be e-mailed to my parents. When Qua.app is triggered by e.g. Calendar (once a month or so) it automatically resizes the photographs and e-mails them to my parents' e-mail addresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How does it do it?\r\n\r\nIt is a combination of AppleScript & shell script that does:\r\n\r\n- search for predefined keywords (qua_PAR) in kMDItemKeywords metadata attribute of files\r\n- create temp copy of found files\r\n- resize them to max size of 2000 pix\r\n- e-mail photos to predefined e-mail address\r\n- remove original keyword & add \"emailed_CurrentDate\" to kMDItemKeywords metadata attribute of e-mailed files\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Qua?
